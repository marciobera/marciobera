# Hi, I'm Marcio Bera! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with ~15 years of experience developing web applications, APIs, and microservices. I've worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks, including:

- NestJS / Express / NodeJS / TypeScript
- Laravel / Codeigniter / Slim
- MySQL / Postgres / MongoDB / Redis

I'm passionate about creating scalable, maintainable, and secure software that meets the needs of users and businesses. Some of my favorite programming principles and practices include:

- Clean Code / Clean Architecture
- SOLID design
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
- Agile methodologies

I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. That's why I love sharing my knowledge and experiences with others, both through my open-source contributions and my interactions with the wider tech community.

On this GitHub account, you'll find some of my personal projects, code samples, and contributions to open-source software. Feel free to explore, fork, comment, and contribute. I'm always eager to collaborate with like-minded developers and learn from their perspectives.

Thanks for checking out my profile, and let's build some awesome software together! ðŸš€
